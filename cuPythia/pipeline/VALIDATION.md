# cuPythia pipeline — validation record

Every stage of the device-resident generator is gated by an explicit, reproducible
check (run `make check`). This file records *what* is validated and the *numbers*
achieved, so claims are auditable. The guiding rule (the project's standing stance):
**no stage is called "validated" without a real check, and no result is over-claimed.**

The architectural lever that makes all of this possible is the **counter-based
SplitMix64 RNG** (`../common/rng.cuh`): every random draw is a pure function of a
per-event counter, so (a) any event is O(1)-reproducible on any node, and (b) the GPU
and an *identical CPU port* consume the same draws — enabling exact GPU-vs-CPU checks.

## Stage 3 (the headline) — FSR dipole shower, in detail

Setup: e⁺e⁻→Z→qq̄ at √s = 91.1876 GeV, final-state radiation only, one event per GPU
thread (the GAPS decomposition), Pythia `SimpleTimeShower` splitting kernels
$(1+z^2)/2$ and $(1+z^3)/2$, running-α_s trial generation with **flavour-threshold
matching** (n_f = 5,4,3 across m_b,m_c), and the exact Pythia local-dipole recoil.

Correctness:
- **4-momentum conservation** max|Δ| = 1.8e-9 GeV
- **on-shellness** max|p²| = 1.5e-12 GeV²
- **reproducibility** GPU re-run diffs = 0 (counter-RNG)
- **GPU vs CPU port** control flow **100% bit-identical** (every accept/veto decision);
  summed momenta agree to 1.4e-12 (GPU/CPU IEEE transcendental limit — never flips a
  branching decision)

Physics (vs Pythia's own `SimpleTimeShower`, identical setup — `thrust_pythia.cc`):
- thrust agrees to **4.0%** (mean |ratio−1| over all bins) vs Pythia with ME-corrections
  **off** — the apples-to-apples leading-log comparison — ⟨1−T⟩ **0.0690 vs 0.0698**.
- vs *default* Pythia (ME-corrections on) the spread is 23.8%; that gap **is** Pythia's
  ME corrections, a higher-order effect no LL shower carries (GAPS included).

Honest residuals / scope: FSR-only, massless, q→qg & g→gg by default. ME corrections (LL→NLL)
and g→qq̄ are now opt-in (`-DME_FIRST`, `-DGLUON_SPLIT`); the residual LL gap is the exact-Λ
α_s normalisation and MC statistics. An early far-tail (1−T>0.35) excess was traced to **the
observable** (a 4-seed thrust axis missing the true axis on rare multi-jet events), not the
shower — it collapses when the axis is seeded from every particle.

g→qq̄ splitting (`-DGLUON_SPLIT`, the secondary-quark channel; reference counter `thrust_pythia
g2q1` counts status-51 quarks with a gluon mother /2):
- flag **OFF** is byte-identical to the LL shower (N_gqq=**0** exactly, ⟨1−T⟩ 0.0690, 100% GPU≡CPU)
  — the clean A/B isolation gate.
- flag **ON** vs Pythia `weightGluonToQuark=1` (same plain DGLAP kernel), MEcorr off: secondary-pair
  rate **N_gqq = 0.578 vs 0.566 (+2.2%)**, flavour-resolved uds +2.2%, **c +0.3%**, b +6.8%; thrust
  non-regression (0.0702 vs 0.0700); 100% GPU≡CPU; reproducible. Pythia's *default* weight is option 4
  (massive reshape + high-mass damping → 0.5233), a documented future (massive-recoil) path.
- hadronization of the forked multi-string events (`hadronize_mr -DGLUON_SPLIT`, `findStrings` slices
  the chain at each q̄-then-q boundary): **4-momentum conservation exact (1.43e-10)**, on-shell exact,
  reproducible; mult 20.92 vs 21.01 (−0.4%, a gluon kink → quark string-break), drop 3.0% (< the 3.4%
  single-string rate, since forks simplify the region geometry). *Future:* a momentum-compensating
  low-mass collapse-to-one-hadron would recover the dropped (sub-2-hadron) sub-strings; deferred
  because the drop rate is already low and a cross-string recoil risks the exact-conservation guarantee.

## Stage 4 — Lund string hadronization, in detail

Setup: one straight u-ū colour-singlet string at √s = 91.1876 GeV, one string per GPU
thread. Faithful port of Pythia 8.317 string fragmentation: the **zLund f(z) sampler**
(validated standalone, χ²/ndf≈1 across z_max 0.09→0.93), StringFlav meson selection (the
always-drawn spin → pseudoscalars **and** vectors, η/η′ suppression, uds mixing), StringPT
pT (enhancedFraction draw kept), constituent-mass stop test, light-cone longitudinal
kinematics, and an exact 2-body finalTwo with refragment-on-failure.

Correctness: **4-momentum conservation 5.7e-14**, **on-shellness 1.6e-12**, GPU re-runs
bit-identical, **100% GPU≡CPU** (same hadron count per event over 20k), **0 failed events**,
2.7 M strings/s.

Physics (vs Pythia `forceHadronLevel` on the identical single u-ū string,
`multiplicity_pythia.cc`, decays+baryons off both sides): primary multiplicity
**12.64 vs 12.15 (4.0%)**, charged **6.98 vs 6.68 (4.5%)**. The GPU being slightly high is
consistent with the documented residuals (pole masses vs Pythia's Breit-Wigner vectors;
simplified finalTwo). Honest scope: pseudoscalar+vector mesons, uds, pole masses, single
straight string (no gluon kinks yet), no baryons/decays. Not aware of a prior *algorithmic*
(non-ML) GPU Lund port.

## Reproducing
```bash
cd cuPythia/pipeline && make check                 # all GPU stages, gated
# Pythia thrust reference (needs the vendored Pythia built + PYTHIA8DATA):
export PYTHIA8DATA=$PWD/../../pythia8317/share/Pythia8/xmldoc
g++ -O2 thrust_pythia.cc -o thrust_pythia $(../../pythia8317/bin/pythia8-config --cxxflags --libs)
./shower_fsr 200000 && ./thrust_pythia 100000 mecoff && bash compare_thrust.sh thrust_pythia_mecoff.dat
```
